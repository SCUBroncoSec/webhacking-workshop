            <p>Using nothing but your browser, you can find out so much about a site.</p>
            <p>By using <code>Inspect Element</code> to look into what files are used and how a website displays its data.</p>
            <h4>This technique is considered a crime in the state of Missiouri</h4>
            <p>A Missouri reporter a little over one year ago looked into the Missouri teacher records and found that their social security numbers were accessible by looking at the HTML and CSS files. This is a major leak that the Missouri State Department did not secure against and had to commit $50 Million to investigate.</p> <!-- (3/4) nd_3m_4 -->
            <p>The Missouri governor, Mike Parson, even went far enough to say, "We will not let this crime against Missouri teachers go unpunished."</p>
            <p>You can commit a crime in Missouri just by using <code>CTRL + SHIFT + C</code> on windows or <code>Command + SHIFT + C</code> on Mac!</p>
